Version control system is the name given to
software that helps to maintain code progress and history. Git is one of the most used for private and commercial uses. This helps track every change made to a project, what they were, who contributed, and when. Also it includes the why. The reason why is especially important, during the git commit -m "we explain why we committing an edit.". When we are contributing to code and working on a project, it's most commonly done so by a groupo of people, so it is important to have this level of organization to maintain clarity over the project. We can clone a repo, and everyone else can clone it too (Git clone is the command). As we do our work, we can push our changes, we can create branches that can later be incorporated in the main file. Every step is recorded, every version is kept secure. This makes it easier to collaborate, visualize, and work on projects.
